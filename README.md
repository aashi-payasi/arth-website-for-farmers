ARTH – Smart Market Access Platform for Farmers
ARTH is a web-based platform designed to help small and marginal farmers make informed selling decisions by providing reliable, mandi-level price information for fruits and vegetables.

The platform focuses on simplicity, trust, and accessibility, especially for farmers in rural regions.

Problem Background
In India, farmers selling fruits and vegetables face frequent price fluctuations across mandis. Due to the lack of real-time, location-specific price visibility, farmers often sell produce at nearby mandis without knowing if better prices are available within a reasonable travel distance.

Existing government platforms provide price data but often lack usability, actionable insights, and clear decision support for farmers.

Proposed Solution
ARTH enables farmers to:

View verified mandi-level prices for selected crops
Compare prices based on how far they can travel
Decide where to sell to maximize returns
The platform avoids village-level pricing to maintain data reliability and focuses only on trusted mandi sources.

How ARTH Works (Current Design)
Farmer selects the crop
Farmer enters maximum travel distance
System filters nearby mandis within the distance
Prices are displayed in a simple, easy-to-understand format
Farmer chooses the best mandi based on price and feasibility
Current Progress – Phase 2
Frontend prototype built using HTML
Basic UI showcasing problem, solution, and sample mandi prices
Backend structure planned using Node.js and Express
Mock mandi price data created for demonstration
Core workflow demonstrated (proof of concept)
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML (prototype UI)
Backend: Node.js, Express (planned / partially implemented)
Version Control: GitHub
Data Source (Planned): Government mandi data (eNAM / APMC)
